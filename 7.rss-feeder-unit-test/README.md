## Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree: Project 7

# RSS Feed Reader Testing

## Project Overview

In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where you come in.

## Usage Instructions

To run the project,

1. Download the files or clone the repo
2. Open index.html in the main directory in a browser
3. Refer to the test results section compiled on the bottom of the page.
